# Manifest Parser

This package is for parsing the manifest file for fck `package.lock`.

This package also contains an example `package.lock` file for reference

## Warning!

It is current a WIP and only works in one language, with no option for errors. This will be fixed. This package is part of a larger project to add a package manager and proper project file structure to fck. The file structure will be the same as just about anything else:
```
- root
  - src
    | main.fck
    | <<other files>>
  - tests
    | main.fck
    | <<other test files>>
  | package.lock
  | README.md
  - build
    | <<build files>>
```

This project is likely to take some time and will remain unimplemented until a later version.
