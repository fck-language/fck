# Contributing to fck
> Last updated on 2022/01/05

This document is a guide on how to contribute to fck, and are not rules. If you want to change any part of this document, feel free to open a pull request for it!

Also, there exists somewhere on the internet a Notion document that anyone can edit or comment on. This has lots of work in progress ideas, simple architecture/documentation, etc. on it. If you want to have a look or edit it, [this is the link](https://right-wasp-8a0.notion.site/fck-things-959fe1b9eb2446148bc34c957a49b965).

## I just want to ask a question

If you have a question, then open a [new discussion](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/fck/discussions/new) in the Q&A category. Someone will, hopefully, try to answer it.

If you open an issue to ask a question, please note that it will be closed. Whatever question you asked will be moved to the Q&A section of the discussions page.

## Before you contribute...

A few actual rules:
1. No discrimination of any sort.
2. Be kind. If someone suggests a bad idea, don't say that it's a bad idea, be kind and suggest a different way. Then have a discussion about it without getting heated.
3. Check posts in the "ideas" category of the discussions. If your idea is similar to a previous idea, link to the previous one and be specific about how your idea is different.

The next sections outline some general things about fck you should know about before contributing to the project.

### Flavours

Similarly to Linux distros, fck has flavours. Currently, there are the following flavours:
- `pure`\
  The base version of fck. This is what all other flavours are built off of
- `counting`\
  This is the maths flavour. This flavour includes a lot more constants and several mathematical functions such as the gamma and polylogarithm functions.

## Contributing

The following sections describe different sections of contribution from finding errors, to fixing them, to adding in the fix to the source code. The way to fix bugs or add enhancements is to create a new branch and then open a pull request

All the issue templates have labels already added. Please do not remove the labels already there. If you feel as though an extra label would be beneficial, then you are more than welcome to add extra labels.

### Bugs and Docs

Bugs and documentation changes have an issue template on GitHub. This template is what should be followed. Add in as much detail as possible, and don't miss out anything except the blatantly **blatantly** obvious.
In docs, code blocks are some of the most useful things ever. If it makes sense, include them and make sure to highlight them.

### Pull requests

Pull requests are for the purpose of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and updating documentation. Each pull request should have the same template, made available to you when creating the pull request.
