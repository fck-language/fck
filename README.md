# fck
fck is a coding language. You can try it, there are [docs](https://RosiePuddles.github.io/fck/docs) if you need them and even [tutorials](https://rosiepuddles.github.io/fck/tutorial)! So feel free to just mess around with it and see what you think! It's all open source, as can see, and written in C++, or maybe Python if there's no C++ files yet.

Feel free to conribute to development, and if you have any questions, this website [here](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/fck/discussions) seems like a fun place to ask questions, and if I seen any I'll try to answer them.

Okay have a fun day darling xx
