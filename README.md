fck is a coding language. You can try it, there are [docs](https://RosiePuddles.github.io/fck/docs) if you need them and even [tutorials](https://rosiepuddles.github.io/fck/tutorial)! So feel free to just mess around with it and see what you think! It's all open source, and written in C++. There is a Python version that was made first and has basic features. It is no longer maintained after [v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/fck/releases/tag/untagged-800eecca79048ecfdc41)

Feel free to conribute to development, and if you have any questions, this website [here](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/fck/discussions) seems like a fun place to ask questions, and if I seen any I'll try to answer them.

Okay have a fun day darling xx
