# Tests

This has all the tests in it. The tests are all in English with the exception of [`language.rs`](language.rs). This file checks that the lexer is language agnostic. It runs over all the language based keywords and checks that the returned tokens are all equivalent regardless of language.

The tests are currently in progress
